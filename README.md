# Sai Teja Bhoomraogari's Portfolio

## Introduction
Hey there! 👋. Thanks for stopping by. This space is a collection of the things I’ve built, explored, and enjoyed working on, from full-stack applications to creative side projects. 

## About Me
I’m someone who genuinely enjoys building things, whether it’s a functional backend service or a clean, intuitive user interface. I’ve always been curious about how things work, and that curiosity naturally led me to full-stack development. One of the things I love most is the freedom to work from anywhere. Being able to stay productive while exploring new places helps me stay inspired and creative.

## Tech Stack
Outside of coding, I have a soft spot for video editing and turning ideas into visual stories. I’m always looking for new skills to pick up, better ways to solve problems, and people to learn from. I believe in teamwork, staying adaptable, and creating things that are not just useful, but meaningful.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
